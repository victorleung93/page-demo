      <p>A protected area is a clearly defined geographical location that has been identified, devoted, and managed for the long-term conservation of nature and its related ecological services and cultural values, via legal or other effective measures. (IUCN Definition 2008)</p>
      <p>Protected places – national parks, wilderness areas, community conserved areas, nature reserves, and so on – are essential for biodiversity conservation while also contributing to people's lives, particularly at the local level.</p>
      <p>Protected areas are at the heart of attempts to conserve nature and the services it offers us - food, clean water, medicines, and protection from the effects of natural disasters. Their importance in mitigating and adapting to climate change is also becoming more well recognised; it is believed that the global network of protected areas stores at least 15% of terrestrial carbon.</p>
